ZTB: Display data frames in browser / Rstudio Viewer
====================================================

The key word of this package is **fast**. I am tired of those slow packages. No
fancy styling, no delicate customization. All I wanted is a text table appear
on my browser as fast as possible, and rendered by my browser with good fps
when scrolling.
