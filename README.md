ZTB: Display data frames in browser / Rstudio Viewer
====================================================

The key word of this package is **fast**.

I am tired of those slow packages. I don't need any fancy styling or delicate
customization.  All I wanted was a text table appear on my browser as fast as
possible, and rendered by my browser with good FPS when scrolling.
